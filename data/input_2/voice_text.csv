3;Good morning everyone. Ok take a seat.
4;Today we are going to talk about
15;So get into group and tell me the answer to this question. Question is what are the issues you face when tree?
16;Why Reading is important?
32;What are the types of document you read during your stay in your university? So when you are in your university life there are many things you need to beat and you can recall them and tell me what are the issues and why you read and water?
36;So when you are ready? There are three main types of reading.
47;They would be reviewing, scanning and skinny. We are normally on a weekly you may using this.
49;Can anybody tell me what is Praveen?
51;kutte ki biwi
55;finding out what you are going to read in before you actually.
64;Can anyone tell me example of privity? Anybody take a minute and record when you pray
73;discrete and find out what are you what you going to read before you actually you could be any.
79;You don't read the whole document this is a simple technique to know what you are.
83;Example it would be reading an abstract of an research.
92;You read the Abstract to get to know about the researchers, about and and get the idea with their it is relevant you are?
96;So what do you do when you Praveen Battalion?
98;The advantages:
103;get the idea but you will find any text you will get the main.
106;Next one would be your brain begins to make connection and the comprehension will be better and faster you. So you you dhol image on your brain and get the idea what is about. So I knew about read a book. You don't just read the book but you read the back of the book and get the idea of what it up
155;and also you get you pick up great deal of information about the text. For example if you are about to reach 3D research paper UK you go through the Abstract and main parts and give me idea when it when was it written and what is the author and also what is the research about. So you know whether the research paper is relevant you are not as also with that is old to old TB.
194;So the next take would be skinny. Skinny is also like vvv but here you read fastly. You just go through the lines and skip lines and read the main things you feel like and this is used to get the gift of a piece of paper like in previewing you read through the main part which is like an abstract. Hear you go through the whole document but two main to get the gift of the idea anybody know what's that
204;is the important part of a text main? Idea the main topic the significant part of an document.
218;Skin through a paragraph on a book you go through the whole document fastly like super quick and get parties about like you do it every time so you know what is scheme.
222;Can anyone tell me one example of me?
240;Parikini you do everyday in every every minute like whenever you're going to read you just go through the whole document and find out whether it is important you are not with. It's nice to read or not you just go through like you skip line and sir.
247;Why do you skip? You came to get the idea with the particular topic is discussed on
250;the topic is relevant you on.
277;Candy general idea about the author's purpose. Of you and the style so you take a novel and go through skin through your novel and give the idea why the author has written this what is the style and also about his perspective. You don't read the whole novel but just came through light and to determine whether the material suit.
281;Getting to group and tell me how do you do?
292;Why not like preview. In skim through you just read the titles headlines, subheadings and also you look at the last Re.
314;Now show some time some people read the first and the last sentence of each paragraph and just get what is happening what is about to happen. For some people when you take an hour you just read the first chapter and maybe the last paragraph of the last chapter and create the whole day whole story
336;and also you skin through by looking at the important words like a new skim through to find an algorithm. Then you find whether the that word using the document you just came through and see whether the algorithm word is in it and see whether the relevant algorithm is in the document. For the next
355;not so when your skin through UC what is in the document and what are the headlines? What are what are the topics? What are the significant words? So then you would you continue to think the meaning of the day overall? You get the whole idea about the whole text is about. All
357;last and final technique
377;is a high speed reading which is more speed than the scheme. Proof in the gift you hear you look for a specific word or a paragraph on a particular crew. You don't look, you don't read through the document to get the idea but 25
396;sofa and example when you're looking for a phone number in the rainbow book but you do is scan. So you look for the number in the rainbow page by just going through the papers and to find that can you stop bleeding when you find the relevant in.
399;Into groups and tell me by scanning.
402;So I would say Good tips for better.
404;Now so party attend.
438;Back to the types of sweaters. Canon you don't read every word and you just movie eyes throughout the document and fine but is your what is your looking for and also you look, you use the close the tips that are given in the document like forever will be. For example you can see in rainbow pages you just find a number then you look for the number that is starting with S o o 0 1 1 2 and 5.
445;That are the clues given. So when you scan, you don't read every word you too.
460;Everybody get into groups and tell me what are the differences in skimming and scanning and come back next week so that we can discuss the differences between scanning skimming and pre.
461;Thank you have a
